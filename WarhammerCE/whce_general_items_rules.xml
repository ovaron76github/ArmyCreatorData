Close combat against fear causing enemies: At the start of each close combat phase (timing step 1) all units in BTB with a fear causing enemy must pass a leadership test or suffer -1 to their to-hit rolls for the following combat phase. - 2. Losing combat against fear causing enemies:  If a unit comprising models that are not immune to fear is defeated in close combat by enemy units comprising fear causing models, then the break test modifier is doubled if the combined US of all fear causing models in enemy units, that are in BTB with the defeated unit, is higher than the US of the defeated unit. For example, if a unit with US 15 comprising models that are not immune to fear loses combat by 2 and is in BTB with two enemy units each comprising fear causing models with a combined US of 10, then the defeated unit has to pass a break test with a -4 modifier. Stubborn units that are defeated and outnumbered by fear causing enemies, instead suffer a Ld penalty equal to the basic break test modifier (i.e. -2 Ld in the example above). - 3. Immunities: Fear causing models are not affected by the effects of Fear. They also only suffer the effects of Fear from Terror causing enemies (instead of Terror).</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Flail</name><name>Flails</name><description>+2S in first round of combat, Two-handed</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Flying Model</name><description>No additional special rules</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Flying Skirmishers</name><description>Unit does skirmish and follows all rules for skirmishers</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Flying Unit</name><description>Free reforms: unless it charges, this unit can reform for free (no movement penalties) as often as desired during its movement</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Frenzy</name><description>- A frenzied unit that did not declare a legal charge (i.e. a charge that would have resulted in a combat, had the target unit hold) but is in charge range of an enemy unit has to declare a charge to the closest unit it could legaly charge. - Frenzied models get +1A. - Frenzied units always have to pursue and overrun. - Frenzeid units are Immune to Psychology. - A frenzied unit which loses a round of combat, loses Frenzy (after the break test) for the rest of the game. - Mounts (incl. creatures pulling chariots) never gain +1A, unless noted otherwise.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>General</name><description>- Each army has to be led by a general.

In addition if this unit is affected by a RIP spell, it generates X free DD in every magic phase that can only be used to dispel this RIP spell. If multiple elements in a unit have MR (e.g. characters in units) only the highest value (X) is used. Units benefit from the MR of a joined character, even if the spell does not target or affect the character.

In the compulsory movement phase, the player has to pick a point in the front arc of the unit and roll XD6. The unit moves the rolled number in inches in a straight line and may face any direction at the end of its full movement. It cannot turn while moving. Modifiers affecting movement (like terrain or magical effects) apply as normal. If it contacts impassable terrain, the board edge or a friendly unit, it stops 1" in front of the obstacle facing in a direction of your choice. If the roll is high enough to reach an enemy unit, the movement counts as a charge and the target unit gets to make a charge response. If it does not reach a unit but its move would end within 1" of a unit then it stops 1" in front of the unit. The unit flees XD6" and pursues XD6". Units with the “Random Movement" special rule cannot be joined by characters. Characters with the “Random Movement" special rule cannot join units.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Regeneration</name><description>Every time a unit with this skill suffers a wound (after armour and ward saves and after any wound multipliers) roll a D6 for each wound the unit suffered. For each roll that comes up as an X+ the unit ignores a wound. In close combat regeneration rolls are made at the end of combat but before combat result is calculated. Regenerated wounds do not count towards combat result but models that were killed before they could attack are not allowed to strike, even if they are saved by the regeneration at the end of combat.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Scaly Skin</name><description>The model has an armour save of X+.

In this case, the unit can be deployed in one of the following ways: - more than 18" away from the opponents deployment zone. - outside of the opponents deployment zone and at the same time completely out of sight of enemy units and/or within cover. For this purpose all enemy units have 360 degree AOS. If the unit is deployed outside of its own deployment zone it has to be deployed more than 12" away from enemy units. If both armies include scouts, both players roll a D6. The player with the highest roll, starts deploying one of his scout units. Thereafter players alternate deploying one scout unit at a time.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Shield</name><name>Barding</name><name>Shields</name><name>Shields (loses the Light Cavalry special rule)</name><description>+1AS</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Short Bow</name><description>18", S3</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Skirmish</name><name>SKIRMISHERS</name><name>Skirmishers</name><description>- Formation: - Loose formation: this unit does not rank up and always moves in a loose formation. In a legal loose formation models are positioned in a single group and within 1" of at least one other model of the unit. LOS cannot be drawn through this unit (remember that unit and not models block LOS!). - this unit has an AOS of 360° - Moving: - cannot be march blocked, i.e. skirmishers are always allowed to march - each model in the unit moves like a single model, i.e. there are no manoeuvres; the unit has to end its movement in a legal loose formation - does not suffer movement penalties for difficult terrain or linear obstacles - Charging: - When this unit charges a non-skirmishing unit, determine for each model if it is within charge distance of the target unit. Models that are within charge distance are placed in BTB with the respective side of the target unit (if possible) and form a front rank. Models that do not reach the target unit (because there is not enough space to get into BTB or they are out of charge distance) are placed behind the front rank where they form rear ranks and what looks like a regular formation. Command group models or characters that have joined the unit may switch places with models in BTB after the charge move is completed. - Non-skirmishing units charging a unit of skirmishers result in both units lining up perpendicular to the charge line (the distance between the centre of the front of the charging unit and the closest model of the target skirmishing unit within AOS), i.e. it is not possible to arbitrarily “wheel into contact" to change the alignment of the units and thereby the direction of a possible flight and pursuit path. - Charges against other skirmishers: Determine for each model if it is within charge distance of the closest model within AOS of the target unit. Models that are within charge distance form a front rank which is touching this closest model and which is aligned perpendicular to a line through the centres of both units (before the charge move). Models that do not reach the target unit form rear ranks as usual. After the charging unit moved, the charged unit then moves as many models as possible into BTB with the front of the charging unit forming their own front rank while the remaining models form rear ranks as usual. - Shooting: - Models in the unit can draw LOS through other models in the unit. - Templates as well as enemies shooting at this unit suffer -1 to their to-hit rolls. - Close combat: - As long as this unit is engaged in close combat it will stay in a ranked up formation with a front, flanks and a rear. - cannot claim rank bonuses for combat result - do not break ranks (independent of their US). - Other: - character models with Type (Inf) may join the unit and move and shoot like the unit - Single models with US 1 count as skirmishers.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Sling</name><description>18", S3.

Replace the standard bearer with a rank &amp; file model. - Standards are captured by enemy units if the unit with the standard bearer is completely destroyed in CC or if the unit broke from combat and was pursued. Mark one of the pursuing units that is now in possession of the captured standard. Units gain no ingame benefit from captured standards but captured standard may affect the outcome of the game (e.g. victory points). Captured standard may be recaptured if the unit with the captured standard is defeated in CC (see above). In this case the recaptured standard is removed from the game (i.e. it cannot be used by the unit and cannot be captured again). If a unit with a standard breaks from combat but no enemy pursues, the standard is removed from the game.

If the Stupidity-Test is failed, the unit moves in the compulsory moves phase with half movement allowance straight ahead (a troll with M6 would move 3"), skirmisher move in a random direction (scatter dice), flyers always use their ground movement. The unit cannot turn/wheel while moving. If it contacts impassable terrain or the board edge it stops 1" in front of the obstacle. If the roll is high enough to reach an enemy unit, the movement counts as a charge and the target unit gets to make a charge response. If it contacts one of your own units it stops 1" in front of the unit but confuses the unit it bumped into. A confused unit cannot move voluntarily in this movement phase. If it does not reach a unit but its move would end within 1" of a unit then it stops 1" in front of the unit. - 3. Units failing the test cannot declare charges, shoot or cast spells and are Immune to Psychology. - 4. The effects remain until the start of the players next turn or if the unit is engaged in combat (the unit loses ItP immediately after the units get into BTB, i.e. before Timing 1).</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Terror</name><description>- 1. Charge from terror causing enemy: If a terror causer charges a unit and is within charge range, the unit has to pass a leadership test or has to choose the flee! charge response. Units engaged in cc automatically pass this test. - 2. Charging a terror causing enemy: If a unit wants to charge a terror causing unit, it has to pass a leadership test or automatically fails the charge and does not move at all. - 3. Terror causing models also cause Fear - 4. Immunities: Terror causing models are not affected by the effects of Fear or Terror.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Throwing Axes</name><name>Throwing axes</name><name>Throwing axes (exchange for javelins)</name><name>Thowing axe</name><description>6", S like thrower +1, Thrown weapon</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Unbreakable</name><description>- 1.

Mark the BSB or replace it with as suitable model without a standard. - If the BSB has joined a unit and is slain in CC but the unit does not break from combat in the same turn, then the battle standard is removed from the game and can no longer be captured.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item></items><rules><rule
