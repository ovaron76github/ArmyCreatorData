If a model has more than one Breath Attack, it can only use one Breath Attack in a single phase. It can be used either as a Shooting Attack or as a Special Attack when Engaged in Combat. - As a Shooting Attack with March and Shoot: choose a target using the normal rules  for Shooting Attacks (it can be used for a Stand and Shoot Charge Reaction). The attack has a range of 6". A model part with both a Breath Attack and a Shooting Weapon can use both in the same Shooting Phase, however only against the same target. - As a Special Attack when Engaged in Combat: the attack is made at the model parts Agility. Declare that you are using the Breath Attack at the start of the Initiative Step (before rolling to hit), and choose a unit in base contact as a target. No matter if it is used as a Shooting or Melee Attack, the target of the Breath Attack suffers 2D6 hits. The Strength, Armour Penetration, and Attack Attributes (if any) of these hits are given within brackets, such as in Breath Attack (Str 4, AP 1, Flaming Attacks ).

The Discipline of all units within 12" of a friendly non-Fleeing model with Commanding Presence may be set to the Discipline value of that model (this ability follows the normal rules for "Values Set to a Fixed Number", page 16 , meaning that effects modifying the Discipline of the model with Commanding Presence are applied before setting the recipient models Discipline to that value; this value may then be further modified).</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Crossbow</name><name>Crossbow (2+)</name><name>Crossbow (4+)</name><name>Crossbow (3+)</name><description>Range 30", Shots 1, Strength 4, AP 1, Unwieldy</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Crown of Autocracy</name><description>The bearer gains +1 Discipline.

It performs a single Close Combat Attack at Initiative Step  0, with Strength 10, Armour Penetration 10 (regardless of the users Agility, Strength, and Armour Penetration), and Multiple Wounds (D3+1) . The following restrictions apply to Crush Attacks: - They cannot be made as Supporting Attacks. - They never benefit from any weapons or other Attack Attributes the model part may have. - The model part cannot make any other Close Combat Attacks during this Round of Combat (including other Crush Attacks, but can still use its Special Attacks such as Stomp Attacks or Impact Hits).</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Crystal Ball</name><description>After Spell Selection (at the end of step 7 of the Pre-Game Sequence), mark a single enemy model on the opponents Army List.

For example, a model part with Devastating Charge (+1 Strength, Poison Attacks ) gains +1 Strength and Poison Attacks when it is Charging. Remember that Special Attacks cannot be affected by Attack Attributes, so the Model Rules and Characteristic modifiers gained from Devastating Charge are not applied to Special Attacks, like Impact Hits  and Stomp Attacks, unless specifically stated otherwise. This rule is cumulative: a model part with several instances of Devastating Charge applies all Attack Attributes and Characteristic modifiers from all of them when Charging.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Distracting</name><description>Close Combat Attacks allocated towards a model with Distracting suffer a -1 to-hit modifier.

At the start of each Round of Combat, such units must take a Discipline Test , called a Fear Test. If this test is failed, the models in the unit are Shaken  and Close Combat Attacks made by models in the unit suffer -1 to hit, while Close Combat Attacks allocated towards models in the unit gain +1 to hit. These effects apply until the end of the Round of Combat.

The Reform  after Rallying in this case does not prevent the unit from moving nor from shooting, but the unit still counts as having moved. This rule does not apply if a unit fails to rally on the next friendly Player Turn or Flees involuntarily (e.g. as the result of a failed Panic Test , or if it was already Fleeing when being Charged).</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Fight in Extra Rank</name><description>Close Combat.

When a unit uses Flying Movement, substitute its models Advance Rate with the first value given in brackets (X), and their March Rate with the second value given in brackets (Y). A unit using Flying Movement ignores all Terrain Features and units during the Flying Movement. Note that: - It must follow the Unit Spacing  rule at the end of the move. - It is affected by the Terrain Features from which it takes off and in which it lands. - All modifiers to ground movement values also apply to a models Fly values, unless specifically stated otherwise. - When declaring a Charge with a unit with Fly, you must declare if the unit will not use Flying Movement for the Charge Move. - A Failed Charge Move of a unit with Fly must use the type of movement (ground or Flying) that was chosen when the Charge was declared. If the unit would end its Failed Charge Move inside another units Unit Boundary or inside Impassable Terrain, backtrack the move to the units last legal position where it follows the Unit Spacing  rule.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Fortitude</name><description>Fortitude is a Special Save .

If the test is failed, the whole unit must declare a Charge this Player Turn if possible. Frenzy Tests and Restrain Pursuit Tests taken by units with at least one model with Frenzy are subject to Maximised Roll . If there are different Advance Rates available in the unit, the Advance Rate used for the Frenzy Test and for the Charge Range is determined as follows: - If a model has more than one Advance Rate (e.g. due to Fly ), the model must use the Advance Rate that has the highest chance of completing the Charge. - If a unit contains models with different Advance Rates, the unit must use the highest Advance Rate that all models in the unit can use (which will usually be the lowest Advance Rate in the unit). For example, a model with Advance Rate 2" and Fly (8", 16") must use the Advance Rate from Fly. And if a Character in a Combined Unit has Advance Rate 4" while the R&amp;F models have 6", the Combined Unit must use Advance Rate 4". Note that when a unit is forced to declare a Charge due to a failed Frenzy Test, it is not forced to Charge the enemy unit that triggered the Frenzy Test.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>General</name><description>A single Character in the army must be named the General.

Additionally, it does not prevent Characters without Chariot from joining a unit containing a model with War Platform and Chariot. When joined to a unit, it must always be placed in the centre of the first rank, possibly pushing back other models with Front Rank , and must keep its position in the centre of the first rank at all times (as long as it is joined to the unit). If two positions are equally central (e.g. in a unit with an even number of models in the first rank and a War Platform  replacing an uneven number of models per rank), the War Platform can be placed in either of these positions. If the War Platform cannot be placed in the centre of the the first rank, the model cannot join the unit. A War Platform with Mismatching Base can never join a unit, and only a single War Platform can be in the same unit unless specifically stated otherwise.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Weapon Master</name><description>Close Combat.

All units that will be deployed using the Ambush rule must be declared at step 8 of the Pre-Game Sequence  (after Spell Selection), starting with the player that chose their Deployment Zone. Deploy your army as usual, but without the Ambushing units. Starting with your Player Turn 2, immediately after step 2 of the Movement Phase Sequence  (after moving units with Random Movement ), roll a dice for each of your Ambushing units. After rolling for all Ambushing units, all units that rolled 3+ enter the Battlefield from any Board Edge. Place the arriving units with their Rear Facing in contact and aligned with the Board Edge. Ambushers are subject to the following rules and restrictions: - Ambushing models can neither March Move during the Movement Phase in which they arrive, nor can they voluntarily end that Movement Phase farther away from the Board Edge that they arrived from than their March Rate. - Ambushing models count as having moved during the turn they arrive on the Battlefield. - If an Ambushing unit has not entered the Battlefield before the end of the game (e.g. due to failing all its 3+ rolls), the unit counts as destroyed. - An Ambushing unit that enters the Battlefield on Game Turn 4 or later loses Scoring . - An Ambushing Character may Ambush within an Ambushing unit that it is allowed to join (declare this when declaring which units are Ambushing). Roll only one dice for the Combined Unit. - Until arriving on the Battlefield, Ambushing units cannot perform any actions at all, and all their Special Items, rules, and abilities dont work while off the board.</description><id/><maxOccurence>9999</maxOccurence><perModel>false</perModel></item><item><name>Accurate</name><description>Shooting.
